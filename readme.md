# Indie Conquest Adventure

A React side project where I could be creative and learn a thing or two.

I started this project as a personal exercise with the following goals:

- Complete a project from scratch using CodeSandBox
- Try out some of the new React hooks that just came out
- Create a project using all 12 images from Indie Conquest Free Pack 1

What came out of it was this little "choose your adventure" app.
